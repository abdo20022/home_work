/*Describe the difference between var, dynamic.

  var => keyword 
  var age = 25;        // becomes int automatically
  - Dart guesses the type from first value
  - After guessing type becomes fixed
  

  dynamic => Datatype 

  dynamic value = 25;
  value = "Ahmed";     // can change type
  value = true;        // can change type .
  - Accepts any type at any time

 --------

   
   explicitly typed variables in Dart : 

   int age = 25;
   here the compiler made sure the datatype is int cuz we used int 

   var name = "أحمد";
   here the compiler guesses the data type cuz we used a var
